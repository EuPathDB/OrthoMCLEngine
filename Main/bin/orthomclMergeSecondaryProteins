Merge secondary proteins into OrthoMCL groups.  The OrthoMCL groups are made from \"representative\" proteins.
The secondary proteins are in groups where each group is associated with one representative protein.  
Add the secondary proteins into the group that contains their representative.

Usage: $0 rep_groups_file target_groups_file secondary_groups_file1, secondary_groups_file2, ...

Where:
  rep_groups_file:         a standard OrthoMCL groups file, but including singletons (each with a group ID).  space
                           delimited, column contains group ID.  Contains representative proteins only.

  target_groups_file:      the output file.  Contains the same groups as rep_groups_file, but now include the secondary
                           proteins.  Singleton groups are removed.

  secondary_groups_file:   contains groups from previous tier.  No group IDs.  First protein in the list is the representative
